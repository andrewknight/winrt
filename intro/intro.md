# Introducing Qt for WinRT

This thesis documents the development process, as part of a community effort, involved in porting the [Qt 5](/appendix/terms.md#qt) development framework to Windows Runtime ([WinRT](/appendix/terms.md#winrt)). WinRT is an application runtime environment and corresponding set of Application Programming Interfaces ([API](/appendix/terms.md#api)) for Microsoft's Windows 8 family of operating systems. Qt is an actively developed [open-source](/appendix/terms.md#open-source) and [cross-platform](/appendix/terms.md#cross-platform) C++ development framework used primarily for the creation of dynamic, high-performance graphical user interfaces ([GUI](/appendix/terms.md#gui)).

The roots of the Qt for WinRT project began in late 2011 as a challenge from my employer, [Digia](/appendix/terms.md#digia). The initial investigation yielded [Qt on Metro](/appendix/references.md#qt-on-metro), a proof-of-concept allowing a Qt 4 application (using Qt Quick 1) to run within the Windows 8 "Metro" (now known as [Modern UI](/appendix/terms.md#modern-ui)) environment. Given that Nokia (the proprietor of Qt at the time) had publically announced its partnership with [Microsoft](/appendix/references.md#microsoft-and-nokia-announce-partnership) (indicating a transition away from Qt and towards Windows Phone), Qt on Metro garnered attention both [from the press](/appendix/references.md#tietoviikko-qt-coverage) and the [community](/appendix/references.md#initial-qt-on-winrt-investigation). As Qt on Metro was only a limited proof-of-concept, the effort was refocused in late 2012 with Qt 5 as a basis, and the initial port was demoed at the Qt Developer Conference in November 2012 as a [Digia research project](/appendix/references.md#qt-developer-days-2012-windows-8-demo). With continued efforts by myself, my colleagues, and members of the community, an announcement was made detailing the [kick-starting and continued development of Qt for Windows Runtime](/appendix/references.md#port-to-windows-runtime-kick-started).

WinRT provides a common API for writing applications that run within the Windows 8 Modern UI environment, a touch-oriented user interface interface available on Windows 8 PCs, tablets, and smartphones. For PCs, it blurs the boundaries between the traditional notions of desktop (keyboard & mouse) and the mobile (touch-screen oriented) interfaces, while placing tighter restrictions on applications by running them within a platform security "[sandbox](/appendix/terms.md#sandbox)". Such applications are eligible for sale in the [Windows Store](/appendix/terms.md#windows-store), a marketplace for applications and other media for Windows-based devices. From the point of view of this thesis, WinRT is a platform "target" which encompasses all the devices which utilize the WinRT API, including the similarly-named [Windows RT](/appendix/terms.md#windows-rt) operating system (the [ARM](/appendix/terms.md#arm)-only version of Windows 8 geared for the Microsoft Surface and similar tablet devices), as well Windows 8 (for desktop PCs and notebooks) and Windows Phone 8.

As a cross-platform framework, Qt provides a clean and consistent way for developers to utilize the same source code across a variety of software platforms. This is important, as platforms generally provide utilize different, source-incompatible GUI toolkits. Qt is one solution developers can use to limit the amount of platform-dependent code required for multi-target development, as well as limiting the amount of platform-specific learning required to build apps for different platforms. While Qt has a long cross-platform history, its support for non-Nokia mobile operating systems (such Android and iOS) is a recent addition. As Qt gains support for these mobile platforms, WinRT makes a natural fit to further fill out the Qt cross-platform story. As an open-source project, it provides a quality infrastructure for contributors to commit changes and improvements to the framework.

While Qt 5 is engineered to be [easy to port to new platforms](/appendix/references.md#introducing-qt-50), it is not without its challenges. Over the course of this thesis, these challenges will be discussed in depth. Given the size of Qt ([300,000+ lines of code and over 200 active developers within the community](/appendix/references.md#qt-statistics)), it is impossible to cover all aspects required to completely port WinRT to Qt. As such, the scope has been limited only to those aspects which are most related to the development of user interfaces, with less emphasis on the non-presentational components of Qt. As a result, there is a selection of low-level (i.e. compiler/toolchain) requirements within the Qt/WinRT relationship, middle-level details such as the OpenGL graphics stack, and some of the higher-level details like UI library and platform style integration - essentially, a bottom-up log of how it was possible to get Qt GUIs running within the WinRT environment. To complete the solution, the issue of developer experience is addressed through a "tuning" the existing Qt tools for use with WinRT and an evaluation of the usefulness of the new port as compared to other Qt platform targets.
